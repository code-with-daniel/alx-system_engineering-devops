# ALX Software Engineering Self-Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my self-paced journey through the ALX Software Engineering curriculum. This repository contains folders for each topic I cover — with code, exercises, and personal notes.

Each folder includes:
- Scripts I wrote while learning the topic
- A `README.md` explaining what each script does
- Key takeaways and concepts I’m exploring

## 📚 Topics Covered So Far

- [0x00-hello_world](./0x00-hello_world)
- [0x01-variables_if_else_while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while)
- [0x02-functions_nested_loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops)
- More coming soon...

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- C Programming
- Bash Scripting
- Git & GitHub

## 🎯 Goal

To deeply understand software engineering fundamentals by building from scratch, documenting everything I learn, and tracking my growth over time.
