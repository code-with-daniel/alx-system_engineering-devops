# My Learning Journey with the ALX Course

This repository is where I track my self-learning progress as I go through the ALX course. The course covers various aspects of software engineering, including data structures, algorithms, front-end, back-end, and more.

Here, I will document everything I learn, share my projects, and write down key takeaways, challenges, and resources that helped me along the way.
