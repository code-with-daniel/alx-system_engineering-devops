# My Learning Journey with the ALX Course

This repository is where I track my self-learning progress as I go through the ALX course. The course covers various aspects of software engineering, including data structures, algorithms, front-end, back-end, and more.

Here, I will document everything I learn, share my projects, and write down key takeaways, challenges, and resources that helped me along the way.

## Learning Progress

- **Week 1: Introduction to Programming**

  - Learned the basics of programming in C, variables, data types, and operators.
  - Completed hands-on exercises on writing simple programs.

- **Week 2: Data Structures**

  - Learned about arrays, linked lists, and basic sorting algorithms.
  - Started practicing problems on sorting and searching algorithms.

- **Week 3: Algorithms**
  - Focused on Big O notation, understanding algorithm efficiency, and recursion.
  - Completed challenges related to recursion and sorting algorithms.
